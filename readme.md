MessageBoxJS
================

Keeping in the spirit of using my blog as a quick code repository; 
sometimes you just need a simple easy to implement dialog box. I 
have been using the following routine for sometime now. Sometimes 
you just need a simple piece of code to get the project done. This 
although is very simple, it does the job perfectly. It is not how I 
often style it, but you can figure that out.
